# Package Parser
Small script for parsing and validating packages.

## Use
**Package Parser** requires all the Netuitive packages to be cloned in the same directory so **Package Parser** can crawl that directory. **Package Parser** filters for folders which start with **netuitive-packages-** so it's fine with clone this project in the same folder as all the packages.

To run the report run `node index.js <package-directory>`.
